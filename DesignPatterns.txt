Server Side Component
1. Abstract Factory groups object factories that have a common theme. 
2. Chain of responsibility delegates commands to a chain of processing objects.
3. Facade provides a simplified interface to a large body of code.
4. Proxy provides a placeholder for another object to control access, reduce cost, and reduce complexity.
5. Singleton restricts object creation for a class to only one instance.
6. Adapter allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together.
7. Iterator is uset for iterating through sentences and words 
8. Strategy allows us to select an algorithm while the application is running
